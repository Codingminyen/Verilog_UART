# Verilog_UART

In this project, an UART module is implemented with verilog.
The implemented UART module contains one reciever and one transmitter.
Both reciever and transmit has their own trigger for baud rate.
The clock frequency is set to be 100kHz and baud rate is 9600bps.

The following image shows the result of testbench.
